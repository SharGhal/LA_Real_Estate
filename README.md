# LA_Real_Estate

Students: Sharon Ghalchi and Trong Kim 

This repository analyses the real estate market in Los Angeles. In our first notebook, we take a look at Real Estate Housing Prices in Los Angeles over the course of the last 12 years using Zillow Data to see how real estate housing prices have shifted as a result of COVID-19. We then use the the prices from 2010-2019 to create a linear regression model that predicts what the housing prices in Los Angeles should have been between 2020-2022 if they stayed on trend. Finally, we compare our linear regression line to the actual prices over the last two years. In our second notebook, we take a look at the Price to Rent Ratio throughout LA to analyze a potential housing bubble in the city.
